	State     int
	EventType int
	EventData interface{}
)

// Events are the basic units that can be processed by a state machine.
type Event struct {
	Type EventType
	Data EventData
}

// Various EventHandlers can be registered to process events in particular states.
// By registering event handlers we build up a mapping of state x event -> handler
// and the handler is invoked exactly in the defined state when the defined event
// is emitted.
//
// Once a handler is invoked, its role is to take the StateMachine into the next
// state, doing some useful work on the way.
//
// If an event is emitted in a state where no handler is defined,
// ErrIllegalEvent is returned.
type EventHandler func(s State, e *Event) (next State)

// StateMachine is the only struct this package exports. Once an event is
// emitted on a StateMachine, the relevant handler is fetched and invoked.
// StateMachine takes care of all the synchronization, it is thread-safe.
// It does not use any locking, just channels. While that may be a bit more
// overhead, it is more robust and clear.

// CONSTRUCTOR ----------------------------------------------------------------

// states and events, set internal channel size. As long as the internal channel
// is not full, all the exported methods are non-blocking.
